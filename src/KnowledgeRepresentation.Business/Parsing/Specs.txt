Domain sentences:
    A lasts d causes α if π
    A lasts d releases f if π
    π triggers A
    A invokes B after d if π
    A impossible at t

Queries:
    always executable Sc
    ever executable Sc
    always holds γ at t when Sc
    ever holds γ at t when Sc
    A always occurs at t when Sc
    A ever occurs at t when Sc

Domain sentences/queries syntax: one sentence/query per line (i.e. new line is expression separator)

Scenario syntax (sample):

    Scenario_name:
        T = 123
        ACS = (some_action, 3) (some_action2, 5)
        OBS = (a & b | !c, 0)


From now on, every sentence/query/scenario will be called just a "sentence".

If we want to denote boolean value, use true/false, not 0/1 (easier to parse, as it may be treated as keyword).
&/| is easier to parse by-hand than &&/|| ;)
Whitespaces do not matter (except newline - it DOES matter).
Formal grammar won't be provided ;)
